require './config/environment' #this gives all the stuff that the environment load
#instead of loading the same thng over and over again, we just load what we need in the environment
#the config.ru file alos load this environment file. 
#environment is basically the file that loads everything, includeing the app file

require 'sinatra/activerecord/rake' #this is what gives rake all those db tasks. rake byitself doesnt have that
